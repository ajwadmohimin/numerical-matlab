# numerical-matlab

These scripts were a part of my final project in the course ME382 - Numerical Methods in Engeering. So, the mathematical functions used here
are very specific to the given problems. But they can be changed and adopted according to the need.

scripts directory contains the followings:

**Problem 1:** Root finding by false position method. \
**Problem 2:** Gauss Elimination method. \
**Problem 3:** Integration by Simpson method. \
**Problem 4:** Lagrange's Interpolation. \
**Problem 5:** Runge-Kutta 2nd order method.
